That is 6 years to the dot. Seems only fitting to start a new blog
reflecting on the past years and on blogging itself.</p> <p>Firstly, I am glad to have marked my knowledge of the world and of my interests at a point in time
as well as having made it public. The writing pretty much sucks (this will too, probably), and it
makes me sad to not have kept up a consistent blog, but there is a certain charm in capturing your
thoughts (and by extension self) in the past, and also in public.</p> <p>It is a weird feeling, even though my principles haven’t changed much, I have spent a good chunk of
the last 6 years chipping away at problems of the world that bug me the most, challenging my
solution ideas with brilliant people, breaking them (and in turn myself) down and building them back
up again and again. I am proud to have kept my ideals and aspirations through the years while still
striving for learning as much as I can while being open minded. I don’t feel like I have changed,
but rather grown, and given that I had completely forgotten its existence before starting to work on
my updated site, reading it was like reading a stranger’s promises.</p> <p>Reading past aspirations or bucket lists can be daunting at times, but this one was a joy (still
cringe at times). Despite having forgotten its existence, maybe having written and promised this to
the world guided me subconsciously in the past 6 years, because I actually seem to have stuck to the
lists I have made and learned a good chunk of the things I have listed:</p> <!> <p>I seem to have dropped the ball when it comes to the piano pieces, and this reflection makes me want
to pick it back up (I did learn a lot of Ludovico Einaudi pieces and I even got to see him live!),
but one step at a time.</p> <h3 id="what-now">What Now?</h3> <p>This reflection serves as both a checkpoint and a new starting line and betting on that writing goals
down and sharing them publicly might guide me subconsciously in the years to come, I would like to
commit to new things.</p> <p>My current focus mirrors three core themes from that original list:</p> <!> <p>Here’s to showing up consistently, embracing the cringe of public learning, and leaving better
breadcrumbs for future me.</p>`,1);function bt(w){var i=vt(),n=m(M(i),8);J(n,{categories:[{id:"books",label:"Library",icon:"📚",items:[{title:"1984 by George Orwell",status:"completed"},{title:"Brave New World by Aldous Huxley",status:"completed"},{title:"Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoevsky",status:"completed",note:"Was my favorite book for a long time"},{title:"East of Eden by John Steinbeck",status:"completed",note:"Favorite book of all time right now.
